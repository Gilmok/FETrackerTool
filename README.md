# FETrackerTool
A tracker for Final Fantasy IV Free Enterprise

Getting started
Download all files and put them into the same directory.  You do not need to download the java file if you do not want to see the source code.

When you select File: New Seed it will prompt you to input the FF4FE flagset.  This will set all objectives.

The tracker will put all objectives in the objective tab.  You can then select the Tracker tab to begin tracking.
You will see images of the key items as well as a list of available locations. Objectives are marked in red and sorted higher in the list than normal.

Key Items needed for objectives in the seed are marked with a faint yellow background.  
Once you have found an item, click on it to mark it as collected.  This will turn it green.  You can click it again once it has beeen used and it will be colored blue.

For locations, once you have visited a location, click on it to have it disappear from the list.  If you visited an objective, the tracker will autmatically mark that objective as completed.
Completed objectives are tracked as you find items and visit locations.  
Some objectives cannot be tracked this way (such as boss kills, character finding, and dark matter hunts) and must be checked manually.

There is also a marker for having a Moonveil, Slow Battle Speed reminder, DMist killed reminder, and GO mode, which means no more key items need to be found.

Real time tracking is not yet available.

The Location Editor is for setting priorities of locations.  Lower priority = higher in list.  Objectives are adjusted to priority 1 on the fly, while non-objective locations are assigned a priority based on time to complete.  The latest version has all locations adjusted to above priority 1 so that objectives appear at the top of the list.  

Enjoy!
